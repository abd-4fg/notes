Description:

Most often Developers for their ease of use,leave API keys and some sensitive keys ,Tokens as hardcoded strings,which isn't really a good ideas as it can result in Leaks of sensitive information getting in Wrong Hands which indeed can results in Data theft and Tampering with how the application deals with the data, and API requests the application Makes.


Steps to reproduce:-

1.Decomiple the app.
2.Look for sensitive information/API keys at the following path:- 
Go to Resources.arsc > res > values > strings.xml
3.I found the follwoing google API keys:- AIzaSyCfGJt73N5SU2JW1Afh9umxS0CzToyXAo0
4.Visit the follwoing link to confirm the usage of this API keys:- https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=19.255669,72.976208&zoom=12&size=2500x2000&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyCfGJt73N5SU2JW1Afh9umxS0CzToyXAo0

Proof of Concept:
Screenshots has been attached as a proof of concept.

Impact:-
If an attacker decompiles your apk, and extracts your token, they can indeed maliciously send traffic on your behalf.
This is the case with pretty much every single one of the web companies out there (google included).
The main thing to know however, is that it is rarely useful for people to do this. Polluting someone else's data while possible, isn't exactly a profitable thing to do. You can also create server-side filters to help prevent this thing from happening.
